Building and installing libcxx:

1. Clone llvm-project into $BIZHAWKGITROOT/waterbox/llvm-project
	* I used eaae6dfc545000e335e6f89abb9c78818383d7ad, which was the tip of origin/release/10.x at the time
2. Come to this folder
3. Run ./do-everything.sh
	* This isn't resumable at all, so if it crashes or you're curious about the process,
	read its source and execute the commands individually.
