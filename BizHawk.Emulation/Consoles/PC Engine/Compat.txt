*                   Turbo CD Issues                  *
******************************************************

- Graphics corruption:
  - Camp California, check seagull during opening
  - In part of Dungeon Explorer II intro
  - Popful Mail... some corruption on Turbo Engine too.... and pcejin?

Still some lesser issues with cancelling a fadeout. Otherwise CDDA is working now...
  - Develo Magazine demo game

- JANSHIN DENSETSU sets the T flag prior to an LDA instruction; MANY TIMES (ie it doesnt seem to be an accident).
  Unclear if T flag actually affects LDA instruction.
- Gradius II sets T flag prior to an STZ instruction. Unclear if T-flag affects STZ instruction.
- Ryuuko no Ken is all messed up, and I don't super care :|
- Record of Lodoss War wont start game from title screen
- Valis: Screen is black during entire intro section

======= TurboGrafx compatibility issues =======

General: 
 + LFO is not implemented, though I can't tell.
 + Screen resolution is an ongoing issue. Some games appear to show garbage beyond what it supposed to be visible.
   Most emulators simply crop the screen at a certain vertical range. For now, I have chosen not to do this.
   Right now the emulator is simply displaying a framebuffer. Eventually, we will do an update that emulates NTSC.
   But for now we're letting this be. There's no intermediate step between emulating a framebuffer and emulating a TV.
+ Adding to this, there are only a handful of Hucards that do crazy thing with screen resolution, and our framebuffer
  approach mostly seems reasonable. On TurboCD the situation changes somewhat, while the normal "gameplay" screens
  are pretty standard, the various intro screens tend to do much more crazy stuff with the 'active display region' 
  much more frequently than was done on Hucards, and our framebuffer/active display strategy starts to look more silly.
  Oh well, though. Changing this is a Native Version Core feature, not a C# Core feature.

Eagan's Rendered Sprite Demo - demonstrates sprites that shouldnt be displayed (so does Turbo Engine!)

===================================
Games that need TV Emulation (to varying degrees)
===================================

Greater degrees:

Final Blaster     - Intro does crazy shit with video modes; not sure what if anything to do about it
Griffon           - Mid-frame res changes (hax to make playable)
Yo, Bro           - Mid-frame res changes (hax to make playable) (IF YOU CAN CALL THIS GAME PLAYABLE)

Lesser degrees:

Aero Blaster      - Bottom of Screen extends too many lines - like 3 extra or so
Alice             - Screen too tall; glitches when scrolling up, but in mednafen in turboengine also,  
                    but not Ootake; could be a timing artifact, or Ootake is cutting off the top
Dead Moon         - Screen is too tall
Jack Nicholas Golf- Some screens are too tall and reveal bad gfx below the intended visible screen
Legend of Hero Ton- Slight gfx issue on top of screen
Madoo Granzort    - Screen ~5 pixels too tall
Metal Stoker      - Tearing when scrolling vertically at bottom of screen - screen too tall?
Side Arms         - Screen is like 4 pixels too tall


Game Express card games don't work yet. 

===================================
Stuff I Fixed That's Not In Other Docs:
===================================

+ Street Fighter II special mapper
+ Populous has special SaveRAM, 32k starting at page $40.
+ After Burner - There is a 1-instruction delay on changes to IRQ Control Byte taking effect
+ There is a one-instruction delay on changes to the I flag taking effect
  - Affects (Not a complete list): Blodia, Body Conquest 2, Champions Forever Boxing,
    Cross Wiber, Jackie Chan, Jigoku Meguri, New Adventure Island, World Beach volley
+ Writing to the SATB location register of the VDC requests a VRAM->SAT DMA even if the SAT DMA
  bit is disabled in the DCR.
+ This is in other docs, but Fighting Run requires full MWR register emulation including the various
  4 color modes. It appears to be the only game that requires this, and it's a shitty game. :(
+ The ROM of Paranoia (J) that is commonly labeled as the authoritative dump - I assume its a bad
  dump, because it dies during the 3rd stage on ALL EMULATORS. Alternative versions of the rom 
  work fine.
+ Puzzle Boy - requests frame height of 512... cap active display to 242 lines
