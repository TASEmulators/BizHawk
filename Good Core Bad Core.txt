Good Core:

Completely separated from UI.
Minimal MSVCisms or GCCisms in code.
No OS-specific code.
All file IO access can be abstracted away to streams or byte arrays.
Optical disk access, if applicable, through GetToc() and GetSector() type primitives.
Multi-instance capable.
Multi-threading, if applicable, is handled internally.  The frontend will call FrameAdvance()
  on a single thread and callbacks will be marshalled back to that thread.
Settings and preferences, where applicable, can be specified by the frontend.
Flat C-style exportable API

Bad Core:

Core intertwined with UI and movie recording systems.
Compiles only with oddball/crappilers.
OS-specific system calls everywhere.
Direct file IO that can't be trapped or rerouted easily.
Optical disk access through cruddy cuebin system that can't be replaced easily.
Single instance.
Sloppy multithreading, or main program loop that can't be easily factored out.
Settings and preferences go to untrappable file IO or central registry.
Convoluted object oriented APIs or no organized API at all
