                        ;   immediately preceeding code for the instruction to be tested. Results are
                        ;   tested first, flags are checked second by pushing them onto the stack and
                        ;   pulling them to the accumulator after the result was checked. The "real"
                        ;   flags are no longer valid for the tested instruction at this time!
