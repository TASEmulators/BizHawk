## For all development

BizHawk's source is hosted with Git.
- Linux
	- If it's not already installed, the package name is probably `git`.
- macOS
	- Git comes with Xcode, or it can be installed manually or with Homebrew ([full instructions](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)).
- Windows
	- Your IDE probably has Git support, or you could install the Git CLI, or a GUI such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or [GitKraken](https://gitkraken.com).
	- You can also use Git from within WSL2.

To download the repo, first make sure you have a fork on GitHub (check the dropdown beside the "Fork" button at the top of the page).
Then clone your fork with Git.
You should add the main repo as an extra remote (upstream) to stay up-to-date. With the CLI that would look like:
```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk.git
git fetch upstream
git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
```

Before touching the code, create a new branch off `master` with a descriptive name.

After touching the code, commit your changes. Try to group your changes into many smaller commits with a clear purpose to each—committing early and often can help. Bonus points if each commit can build and run.  
If you made the branch a while ago, pull `master` and *rebase, not merge*. Then push to your fork, and you can submit a pull request at any time on GitHub.  
Your commit message summary [should be written](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#_commit_guidelines) in the *imperative* tense (imagine "This commit will ..." comes before it). GitHub wraps at 70 chars.  
The description should include any non-obvious effects the changes will have. If you feel you need to explain what the code does, consider using code comments instead. It's okay to leave the description blank for simple commits.  
You can use limited Markdown in the summary and description, including monospace, commit/Issue links, and, in the description, bullet points.
In the description, link to related commits and Issues with a short-hash (`abc123def`) or ID (`#1234`), respectively. If your commit fixes an Issue, put it in the summary and use a [closing keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

It's probably a good idea to get the .NET SDK, even if you're not working on a .NET project, so that you can test your changes in EmuHawk.



## For any: .NET project

- Linux
	- Install the .NET 8 SDK (package name is usually `dotnet-sdk-8.0`, see [full instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux)).
	- VS Community isn't available for Linux, but Rider and VS Code are.
	- Nix/NixOS users can get the .NET SDK ephemerally with the provided `shell.nix`. For IDE setup and more, see the [Nix-specific docs](Dist/nix_expr_usage_docs.md#ide-setup).
- macOS
	- Note that EmuHawk does not currently support macOS.
	- Install the .NET 8 SDK [manually](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/macos) or with Homebrew.
	- VS Community isn't available for macOS, but Rider and VS Code are, and [for now](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/what-happened-to-vs-for-mac) so is VS for Mac.
- Windows
	- The .NET 8 SDK comes with [VS Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community) (see [full instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/windows)).
	- You can also use Rider, VS Code, or something else instead of VS Community.

For EmuHawk and libraries in the main solution, which do not target .NET 8, we have [this page](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/wiki/Available-C%23-and-.NET-features) documenting which features are actually available to use.  
We also have [supplemental docs](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/wiki/C%23-and-.NET-docs-supplement) on some of the language's footguns.



## blip_buf
> Audio resampling library.

Uses C.



## Encore
> Build scripts for the (unmanaged side of the) Encore port.

Uses C++.



## Cygne
> The unmanaged side of the Cygne core from Mednafen.

Uses C++.



## DiscoHawk
> DiscoHawk is a companion app for cleaning up disc images.

See [EmuHawk](#emuhawk). Build scripts also build DiscoHawk, or from VS2022 choose a DiscoHawk configuration.



## EmuHawk
> EmuHawk is the main app, an emulator frontend.

Uses C#; you will need the .NET SDK or an IDE which includes it. See the [.NET section](#for-any-net-project).
Most projects target .NET Standard 2.0, with some targeting .NET Framework 4.8. It's written at the top of their project files, or you can check the [project graph](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/wiki/Dependencies#main-solution).

The source for EmuHawk, plus DiscoHawk and the supporting libraries, is in `/src`, with a few extra files used by the build system elsewhere.
EmuHawk's project file `/src/BizHawk.Client.EmuHawk/BizHawk.Client.EmuHawk.csproj` includes the other projects [in a tree](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/wiki/Dependencies#main-solution), and they're all included in `/BizHawk.sln`.

In VS2022, open `BizHawk.sln`, then select the "BizHawk.Client.EmuHawk | Release" configuration to build and run.
To build from the command-line on Windows, simply run `dotnet build BizHawk.sln` from the repository's root, and then `output\EmuHawk` will be available. Alternatively, you can run one of the existing build scripts that apply additional checks and configurations, such as `Dist\QuickTestBuildAndPackage_Release.bat`.
To build from the command-line on Unix, run `Dist/BuildRelease.sh`, and then `output/EmuHawkMono.sh` will be available.

There are 2 build configurations. Besides `Release` there is `Debug`, which *does not run* bytecode optimisations, *does not remove* debugging symbols, *enables* additional logging and assertions, and *enables* some features. On Windows, a `Debug` executable will spawn a console window for stdout. Note there is also a "stronger" release build in the form of `VersionInfo.DeveloperBuild == false`, which is only used by GitLab CI for preparing a release (during `Dist/UpdateVersionInfoForRelease.sh`).

We have an automated test suite in the solution which runs in CI, though you can and should run it before pushing.
There are also [various Analyzers](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/wiki/Roslyn-Analyzers-(third-party)) (static code analysis plugins) for detecting common mistakes and checking code style. These are disabled by default for the main solution; pass `-p:RunAnalyzersDuringBuild=true` to the build script, or set the env. var `MachineRunAnalyzersDuringBuild=1`.
In addition, not every style rule is currently enabled, so please make sure you use CRLF, tabs, and [Allman braces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style) (but don't try to fix code you're not working on).

There are additional test suites specifically for regression-testing cores—these are not included in the solution and need to be run manually. See [the base project's readme](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/blob/master/src/BizHawk.Tests.Testroms.GB/readme.md) for details.
