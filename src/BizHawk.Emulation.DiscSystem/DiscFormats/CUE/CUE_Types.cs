	//All audio files (WAVE, AIFF, and MP3) must be in 44.1KHz 16-bit stereo format.
	//BUT NOTE: MP3 can be VBR and the length can't be known without decoding the whole thing.
	//But, some ideas:
	//1. we could operate ffmpeg differently to retrieve the length, which maybe it can do without having to decode the entire thing
	//2. we could retrieve it from an ID3 if present.
	//3. as a last resort, since MP3 is the annoying case usually, we could include my c# mp3 parser and sum the length (test the performance, this might be reasonably fast on par with ECM parsing)
	//NOTE: once deciding the length, we would have to stick with it! samples would have to be discarded or inserted to make the track work out
	//but we COULD effectively achieve stream-loading mp3 discs, with enough work.
