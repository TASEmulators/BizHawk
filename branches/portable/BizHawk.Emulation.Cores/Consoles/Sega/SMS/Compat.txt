======= SMS compatibility issues =======

Note: add PS1J-retranslation to gamedb

Korean games currently not booting:
 - FA Tetris
 - Flashpoint
 - Sky Jaguar boots but gfx issues (works in cogwheel) (but not in MEKA!)

* Desert Strike - you can enter the map screen but cannot leave.

- Light Gun emulation
- Paddle emulation
- Sports pad emulation?

======= Game Gear compatibility issues =======

* Outrun has raster effect on the wrong line. I've been able to modify interrupt code to
  fix it, but so far, not without breaking other games.

======= SG-1000 compatibility checklist =======
