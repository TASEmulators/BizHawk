06/19/2011 - MTPO = sync, smb = sync, fist of the north star = doesn't sync (and is very sync unstable in fceu versions)

NES - In general, it's very laggy, and doesn't seem to want to turbo. Audio is always messed up in some way.
 
Adventures of Lolo (1268M) fails. Odd audio.
The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle (3155S) has issues with emulating the bass track of the sound. It holds notes way longer than necessary. Also, in FCEUX, the dead enemies kick their legs even after I collect the last carrot. Here, they remain static. It's almost like a drone. That said, it syncs perfectly.
Journey to Silius (1014M) fails to sync nearly instantly, which is a bad sign as it's console verified. Also, I can only hear the melody and drum tracks...I'll presume all audio is emulated incorrectly by Bizhawk with NES games.

PCE

Bonk's Adventure (1631M) desyncs on level 1-2 at ~3000 frames.
Dungeon Explorer (1645M) does nothing more than get past the title screen.
Madoo Granzort (1432M) desyncs after hitting the first boss a few times at ~3500 frames.
Shockman (1690M) desyncs at ~20000 frames.
Ninja Spirit (1447M) desyncs right before the first boss battle at around ~5000 frames. The actual desync may have occured earlier, however, as the desync is caused by the player getting killed by an enemy that followed him for a while. This enemy probably should have been killed.
When I had near given up all hope, Viglante (1677M) ran through the entire movie file. It seems to sync just as well at 200%.

Bonk's Revenge (1301M) desyncs at ~2800 frames.
Dragon Egg (1281M) does nothing more than get past the title screen.
Kato Chan & Ken Chan (1291M) desyncs on level 1-2 at ~3900 frames.
Keith Courage in Alpha Zones (1309M) desyncs at ~4200 frames.

That is my report on how the PCE TASes sync. 1/10 of them sync.
