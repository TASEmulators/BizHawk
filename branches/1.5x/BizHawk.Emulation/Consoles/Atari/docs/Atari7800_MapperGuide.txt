==============================================================================
7800 games can use the memory from $0400 to $047f, from $0500
to $17ff and from $2800 to $ffff, but only the High-Score cart
uses anything below $4000. It has 4KB of ROM at $3000-$3fff
and 2KB of battery-backed RAM at $1000-$17ff.


The non bankswitching games (7808, 7816, 7832 and 7848) just
use the specified amount of ROM from $ffff downwards.


Then there are several different types of Atari's SuperGame
bankswitching. It basically consists of 8 16KB banks (0-7)
that can be mapped in at $8000-$bfff. Bank 7 always is fixed
at $c000-$ffff. To map in a chosen bank into $8000-$bfff you
write it's bank number (0-7) to any address between $8000-bfff.
The contend of $4000-$7fff differs between different variations
of this type:

Some games have nothing connected in this area and return only
random data.

Some games have bank 6 fixed at this area.

Some games have 16K of extra ROM there. Those games are 144K
in size and are marked as 78S9 in the list.

Some games have either 8K of RAM at $6000-$7fff or 16K of
RAM at $4000-$7fff.

Some games have a POKEY chip mapped in at this area. It
has 16 addresses that get repeated all the way between $4000
and $7fff.

Some games only have 4 ROM banks at $8000-$bfff (0-3). Banks
4-7 either return the same data as banks 0-3 or completely
random data. PAL Karateka is a special case. It only uses
banks 4-7. Banks 0-3 are random data and bank 6 is also fixed
at $4000-$7fff.


F18 Hornet has it's own bankswitching format (78AB). It has
32K of fixed data at $8000-$ffff and 2 16K banks at $4000 -
$7fff. The two banks get mapped in by writing either $01 or
$02 to address $8000. I don't know if other addresses trigger
the bankswitching too, but I'm assuming any address above
$8000 might work. I have no idea what happens when you write
other values to the hotspot, but they probably will just be
ignored.


Double Dragon and Rampage have a very wierd bankswitching
scheme (78AC). It has 8 16K banks (0-7) that get mapped in at
$a000-$dfff. Write accesses to addresses above $ff80 trigger
the bankswitching. This sets the bank according to the low
nibble of the address. So a write to $ff80 maps in bank 0,
a write to $ff81 maps in bank 1, etc. The games only use
addresses $ff80-$ff87, so I'm not sure if other addresses
trigger the bankswitching too.

If we are assuming that a bank reaches from $a000-$dfff,
then the rest of the ROM space looks like this:

$4000-$5fff second 8kb of bank 6
$6000-$7fff first 8kb of bank 6
$8000-$9fff second 8kb of bank 7
$e000-$ffff first 8kb of bank 7
