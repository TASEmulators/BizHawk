68000:

Timings:

 - MULU/MULS/DIVU/DIVS have funky timings.
 - How many cycles does TRAP take to execute?
 - How many cycles does it take to accept an interrupt?
 - AND has some funky timings when it comes to immediates?

Out of This World... pretty substantially broken
Outrun 2019, much more significant gfx issues. 
Outrun, minor gfx issue. maybe related to h-int timing?
Outrunners, some gfx issues... but not as bad as you might think!!! apparently doesnt use interlace mode?

======================================================
Fixed Issues: (listed for regression testing purposes)
======================================================

(Sprites X/Y are 10-bit, but must be masked to 9-bit)
- Dragon's Revenge.... ball sprite seems missing? of all the sprites to not show up...
- Fire Shark - Sprites dont render... VERY similar to Truxton. Same engine?
- Truxton - Sprites do not appear to be rendering. 
- Zero Wing - Sprites arent rendering.......

Flavio's DMA test... DMAs when it shouldnt!! - Masking off too much of the VDP command code

Fun-n-Games fails its fadeouts.  -- Fixed CRAM reads. I failed math.

Sonic Spinball executes a VSRAM read -- Implemented VSRAM reads.

Bugs related to longword read/write VRAM. Multiple bugs were present including sign-extension and endians and crap.  
 - Crusader of Centy- Text boxes messed up
 - Eternal Champions - immediate gfx corruption
 - Garfield... immediate gfx corruption. debug target.
 - Kid Chameleon - gfx corruption on bounce bricks and level-end effect

Games to test window calculation on:
 - Road Blasters (doesnt use window, but Window & Nametable A are at same location)
 - Out of this World - Same as Road Blasters
 - Musha,Gaiares - Window at top
 - Eliminate Down - Window at bottom
 - Monster World 4, Wonder Boy in Monster World - Window at top - needs window scroll plane size adjustment
 - D&D Warriors of the Eternal Sun - Window at bottom and at sides
 - Truxton, Fire Shark - Window on Right

======================================================

TODO: non-instant DMA emulation
TODO: Add 68000/VDP interrupt enable delay (one instruction, similar to After Burner/PCE)
TODO: H-Ints timing possibly not correct... Some game raster effects work, others don't work as expected. (could be HVC tho)
TODO: Test DMA/ VDP command words.... I'm not at all convinced that VRAM is always correct


==============
Notable games:
==============

Ghouls n Ghosts sets up the graphics planes backwards from normal, by setting the plane A to be low priority and Plane B to be high priority.
If you have a bug in your priority code this may find it.

Revenge of Shinobi will not play DAC sounds if YM2612 registers are not initialized to L/R channels enabled.

Ballz doesnt really initialize hardly any VDP registers, relies on VDP registers powered-on to the correct values

Contra appears to use VDP A0 set = byte-swap. Not sure if its important in anyway in that game, but the byte swap happens.

Games that use VRAM->VRAM Copy: D&D Warriors of the Eternal Sun, MUSHA, Devilish, Viewpoint

Games that require accurate VRAM fill emulation include Thunder Force IV,
 Contra Hard Corps, Revenge of Shinobi, Taiga Drama, and Sword of Vermillion.

Sonic Spinball reads from VSRAM

Games to test for sprite masking/overflow:
 - Sonic 1 title screen (uses overflow to mask)
 - Sonic 2 title screen (uses sprite mask modes)
 - Galaxy Force 2 level select (uses sprite mask)
 - Landstalker sprite masking (chests and such)
 - Nemesis test rom

Games known to use 2-cell vertical scroll mode:
 - Air Diver
 - Exo Squad
 - Contra Hard Corps (giant robot boss on stage 1)
 - MUSHA (stage 3)
