//OLD ideas:
/*
 * do some stuff asynchronously. for example, decoding mp3 sectors.
 * keep a list of sectors and the blob/offset from which they pull -- also whether the sector is available
 * if it is not available and something requests it then it will have to block while that sector gets generated
 * perhaps the blobs know how to resolve themselves and the requested sector can be immediately resolved (priority boost)
 * mp3 blobs should be hashed and dropped in %TEMP% as a wav decode

//2048 bytes packed into 2352: 
//12 bytes sync(00 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00)
//3 bytes sector address (min+A0),sec,frac //does this correspond to ccd `point` field in the TOC entries?
//sector mode byte (0: silence; 1: 2048Byte mode (EDC,ECC,CIRC), 2: mode2 (could be 2336[vanilla mode2], 2048[xa mode2 form1], 2324[xa mode2 form2])
//cue sheets may use mode1_2048 (and the error coding needs to be regenerated to get accurate raw data) or mode1_2352 (the entire sector is present)
//audio is a different mode, seems to be just 2352 bytes with no sync, header or error correction. i guess the CIRC error correction is still there

/*information on saturn TOC and session data structures is on pdf page 58 of System Library User's Manual;
 * as seen in yabause, there are 1000 u32s in this format:
 * Ctrl[4bit] Adr[4bit] StartFrameAddressFAD[24bit] (nonexisting tracks are 0xFFFFFFFF)
 * Followed by Fist Track Information, Last Track Information..
 * Ctrl[4bit] Adr[4bit] FirstTrackNumber/LastTrackNumber[8bit] and then some stuff I dont understand
 * ..and Read Out Information:
 * Ctrl[4bit] Adr[4bit] ReadOutStartFrameAddress[24bit]
 * 
 * Also there is some stuff about FAD of sessions.
 * This should be generated by the saturn core, but we need to make sure we pass down enough information to do it
