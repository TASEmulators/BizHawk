> &dagger; There are no known vulnerabilities in this older release, but our general advice is to update to the latest release, unless you're working on a TAS and it doesn't sync in the new version.

Note that we are not responsible for any unsecure external tools or user-provided scripts (which you run at your own risk),
nor for the .NET Framework (/ Mono), nor any cross-platform compatibility tools (Wine, FEX...).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can send a report to the BizHawk team [here on GitHub](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/security/advisories),
where you can also see all previous reports which have been made public.
> Regular Issues which have been elevated to security issues don't get moved there&mdash;if there is one, it should be pinned at the top of the Issue list until its fix makes it into a release.

If you don't have a GitHub account, please contact one of the below developers directly.
- YoshiRulz: [via email or IM](https://yoshirulz.dev)
- adelikat: [PM on TASVideos](https://tasvideos.org/Messages/Create?defaultToUser=adelikat)

We respect and expect the standard 90-day embargo on public disclosure of vulnerabilities.
