## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can send a report to the BizHawk team [here on GitHub](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/security/advisories),
where you can also see all previous reports which have been made public.
> Issues which have been elevated to security issues won't be shown there&mdash;they will instead be pinned at the top of the list until the next release.
